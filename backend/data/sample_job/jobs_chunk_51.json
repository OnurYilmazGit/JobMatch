Our team believes that advances in AI, perception and simulation will redefine what's possible for industrial robotics in the near future – with software and data at the core.\n\nOur mission is to make industrial robotics intelligent, accessible, and usable for millions more businesses, entrepreneurs, and developers. We are a dynamic team of engineers, roboticists, designers, and technologists who are passionate about unlocking the creative and economic potential of industrial robotics.\n\n\nROLE\n\nThe Release Engineering & Quality Assurance team is responsible for delivering releases of Intrinsic's software platform at high velocity without sacrificing trust in the quality of each release. As a Test Engineer on this team, your job will be to execute and review the tests which demonstrate this quality. When a test cannot be completed, you will document detailed steps for reproducing the error and work with the engineering team to verify that the issue has been resolved. In order to scale our efforts as our scope grows, you will also use your software development experience and the knowledge that you gain of Intrinsic's software to convert manual tests to automated tests.\n\n\nHOW YOUR WORK MOVES THE MISSION FORWARD\n\n * Perform manual tests of Intrinsic software, both in simulation and on real hardware robotics workcells.\n * Investigate and document failures and assist the engineering team with verifying fixes.\n * Develop manual test plans into automated tests in order to scale our quality engineering processes.\n * Support the release engineering team in delivering high quality software releases.\n\n\nSKILLS YOU WILL NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL\n\n * 4-year degree in Computer Science, Robotics, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or equivalent experience.\n * Excellent written communication skills and attention to detail. You will need to concisely describe deviations from expected behavior and provide accurate steps to reproduce errors that you find when running tests.\n * Programming experience with Linux shell scripting, Python, or Go.\n * Experience working with mobile robots or industrial robots in a lab or production environment.\n\n\nSKILLS THAT WILL DIFFERENTIATE YOUR CANDIDACY\n\n * Experience administering industrial robots in a lab or production environment.\n * Experience with Cypress.io, Beautiful Soup, or similar browser automation and scraping tools.\n * Technical writing and/or presentation experience. Have you published any projects with really good documentation?\n * Experience working with software build systems such as Bazel or CMake.\n\n\n\n\nAt Intrinsic, we don't just accept difference - we celebrate it, we support it, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our products and our community. We are proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and an affirmative action employer.
