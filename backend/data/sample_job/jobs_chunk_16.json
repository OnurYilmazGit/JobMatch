In the last years, I was:\n\n\n * CTO at KONUX from September 2018 to April 2022, where I played a pivotal role in shaping the company's tech landscape and products.\n * Sr. Manager at Tesla from November 2015 to July 2018, leading the development of energy storage systems and mobile apps.\n * Vice President of Product Development at Networked Energy Services (NES) Corporation from October 2014 to November 2015, launching a new company and product line in the grid digitalization space.\n * At Echelon Corporation, I held various roles over six years, including Director of Product Management and Development in the Grid Modernization Division.\n * Before my endeavors in the Energy Industry I was working for Hewlett Packard in the Enterprise Software group for a little over 10 years.\n\nI'm all about pushing the boundaries of technology and driving progress in our industry. I spent the majority of my career in the Silicon Valley in California and apply a lot of the methods and drive to my workplace here in Munich.\n\nOur team is the basis of our success, and I'm dedicated to fostering a collaborative, innovative and goal driven work environment.\n\nIf you're ready to be a part of our international crew and share our vision for groundbreaking tech solutions, I encourage you to explore opportunities within our organization.\n\nThanks for considering joining us, and I look forward to the possibility of working together to achieve remarkable things.\n\nBest regards,\nSebastien Schikora\n\n\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\n\nYour contact person is Maria Marin (Talent Acquisition Partner).\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to send us an email to talent@flexa.energy\n\nWe are looking forward to receiving your application!\n\nABOUT US\n\n\n\nFlexa, a Joint Venture between Enpal and Entrix, is chartered with delivering a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) delivering exceptional energy cost savings while supporting the transition to a 100% renewable electricity future.\n\nThe combination of delivering complete residential energy systems at great cost with savvy market participation in several revenue streams sets us up to deliver real world customer savings while improving customer satisfaction enjoying the advantages of a fully electrified and energy producing home.\n\nThrough a deep integration into the installed hardware and a direct connection to the customer interfaces, Flexa’s solution controls the energy assets (such as EV, heat pump, home storage and others) of the entire Enpal energy community with an exceptional level of accuracy, speed, transparency, and thus customer satisfaction.
